# APOLO
This is a song search application that leverages the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) to retrieve track information and the [Lyrics.ovh API](https://lyricsovh.docs.apiary.io/#) to display song lyrics. Users can view song details and listen to a short preview of the selected track, if available.

## Demo Video
#### **`IMPORTANT!`**
Videos played in windowed mode default to low quality (360p). For better viewing, it's recommended to switch to full screen to watch in 720p, or manually adjust the quality settings.
